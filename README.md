Hear

H - ea - ar


wea - the - r
not: wea - th - er
- because `the` is strong and `th` and `er` are lower
- strong contraction > strong groupsign > everything else
- wordsign gets precedence if it is the entire word
- some shortform words can be used as parts of words
  - can be followed by "'s"
- grade 1 is just letters, grade 2 is where non alphabetic characters happen
